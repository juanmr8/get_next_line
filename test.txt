Hola soy una linea\n
Adios soy otra lineaaaaaaaaa\n
You're on the right track, but there are a few issues with your current implementation\n
Process the buffer to find newlines\n
Handle the stash (leftover data)\n

Store the rest in stash for the next call\n
Keep going - you're making progress!RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.\n
