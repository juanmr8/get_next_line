Hola soy una linea\n
Adios soy otra lineaaaaaaaaa
You're on the right track, but there are a few issues with your current implementation
Process the buffer to find newlines
Handle the stash (leftover data)
Return only the current line (up to the first newline)
Store the rest in stash for the next call
Keep going - you're making progress!RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
